# Programming Assignment #4

## Description
Temperature Conversion / Use of Remainder Operator

## Instructions
1. Write a program to perform the following two tasks.
	- Task #1: Print a table of Fahrenheit/Celsius temperatures. The Fahrenheit temperatures must run from 0 to 100, however, they must increase by 10 degrees each repetition. Alongside each Fahrenheit temperature, display its equivalent Celsius temperature (see sample run).
	- Task #2: Ask the user to enter 3 numbers. The first 2 numbers will be a range of numbers to be used in a count-controlled loop. The third number will be used to determine which numbers to print in this range. For example, if the user enters 25, 50 and 6, your program must print all the numbers between 25 and 50 (inclusive) that are evenly divisible by 6 (see sample run).

## Sample Run
	Fahrenheit Celsius
	---------------------
	0 -17.78
	10 -7.78
	20 2.22
	30 12.22
	40 22.22
	50 32.22
	60 42.22
	70 52.22
	80 62.22
	90 72.22
	100 82.22
	Enter 3 numbers: 25,50,6
	The numbers between 25 and 50 that are evenly divisible by 6 are:
	30 36 42 48
